    <h1>Introduction To Selectors In CSS</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Basic Selectors</li>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>Universal Selector</li>
        <p>
          The universal selector provided by CSS helps in choosing any elements
          within the HTML page. It goes with a single element and uses the
          asterisk ( "*") symbol used for denoting the selector as a universal
          selector.
        </p>
        <li>Element Selector</li>
        <p>
          The element selector in CSS is used to select HTML elements that are
          required to be styled. In a selector declaration,there is the name of
          the HTML element and the CSS properties which are to be applied to
          that element is written inside the brackets {}.
        </p>
        <li>Class Selector</li>
        <p>
          The .class selector is used to select all elements which belong to a
          particular class attribute.
        </p>
        <li>ID Selector</li>
        <p>
          The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a
          specific element. The id of an element is unique within a page, so the
          id selector is used to select
        </p>
        <li>Attribute Selector</li>
        <p>
          The CSS Attribute Selector is used to select an element with some
          specific attribute or attribute value. It is an excellent way to style
          the HTML elements by grouping them based on some specific attributes
          and the attribute selector will select those elements with similar
          attributes.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <li>Combinator Selectors</li>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>Descendant Selector</li>
        <p>
          The descendant combinator — typically represented by a single space ("
          ") character — combines two selectors such that elements matched by
          the second selector are selected if they have an ancestor (parent,
          parent's parent, parent's parent's parent, etc.) element matching the
          first selector.
        </p>
        <li>Child Selector</li>
        <p>
          CSS child selectors select an element which is a child of another
          element.
        </p>
        <li>General Sibling Selector</li>
        <p>
          The CSS general sibling selector is used to select all elements that
          follow the first element such that both are children of the same
          parent.
        </p>
        <li>Adjacent Sibling Selector</li>
        <p>
          The adjacent sibling combinator (+) separates two selectors and
          matches the second element only if it immediately follows the first
          element, and both are children of the same parent element.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <li>Group Selectors</li>
      <p>
        The CSS grouping selector is used to select multiple elements and style
        them together.
      </p>
      <li>Psuedo Selectors</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Psuedo Class Selector</li>
        <p>A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.</p>

        ->Style an element when a user mouses over it<br> ->Style visited and
        unvisited links differently <br>->Style an element when it gets focus
        <li>Psuedo Element Selector</li>
        <p>A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.</p>
        ->Style the first letter, or line, of an element<br>
        ->Insert content before, or after, the content of an element
      </ul>
    </ol>
